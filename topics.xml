aged Partial Liht of Dead and
Disabled Accident Occurred ut
Treuiunt and lloylbtoti Streets.
Boston, March 4. An explosion lias just
occurred in the subway excavation at the
corner of Trcraont and Ooylston streets.
Three electric cars that were passing
at the time were wrecked and one ot
them was burned. Several bulldingsin the
vicinity were more or less damaged.
The explosion was caused by escaping
gas.
Among the buildings damaged are the
Hotel Pclliam, the Knickerbocker and
Head buildings and the Masonic Temple.
Window glass in buildings within 200
feet of the scene of the explosion were
shattered.
At least twelve persons were killed.
Four bodies have been removed to un
dertaking' rooms.
Forty-two persons arc at the Emergency
Hospital.
Among the dead are:
Rev. W. A. Slack, professor at Tufts Col
lege. G. I). Bigclow, conductor.
Unknown man and woman.
The injured include James Reardon, John
J. O'Conuor, Thomas F. Ford, Mrs. J. R.
Wilson, Nellie Jackson, Lucy Dolan, F.
W. Tceling, and Mrs. F. A. reck
There seems to be no doubt thatatleast
eight persons were immediately killed.
The explosion came Jutt as the streetcars
were almost in the ceutcr of the space at
the corner.
The first car was In the center when the
explosion came. The whole of the wood
work, which is used as a bridge over the
subway, was lifted into the air, carrying
the first car with it and taking along the
two horses of the second car. The other
Tehlcles were lifted straight into the air,
but came down on the tracks. Instantly
the air was filled with flying debris.
The firat electric car, the one in which
most or the killed were riding, no sooner
reached the track than It broke in hair,
and the whole portion Immediately burst
into flame. Then someone sounded a fire
alarm. This brought a large rescue force
to the scene, and almost immediately calls
were being sent out hurriedly for the am
bulances. It was an awful Eight that met the gaze
of those who were first on the scene. In
the center was the long blazing electric
car. .Close beride this were the bodies ot
the two horses killed instantly, and about
ten, twenty, thirty feet away from where
the woodwork of the car was blazing lay
the dead and wounded people. Those who
wore not injured in the cars on Boylston
6treet were Incapable ot action
at first, and people in the buildings and
stores surrounding did not know what had
occurred, but it did not take them long
to secure their senses, and almost imme
diately there was a rush to the assistance
ot the wounded.
It is stated that there was not a person
on the three cars who was not injured, and
all the wounds received were severe. Im
mediately stores and offices were con
verted into temporary hospitals until am
bulances could arrive. 1 1 was a gruesome
spectacle to see these bodies exposed on
the sidewalks.
Hose carriages were pressed into service
as ambulances, and immediately they were
started on their humane duty or getting the
maimed to the hospitals.
It Is supposed that-one of the dead women
at Jones' undertaking rooms Is Mrs. A. M.

RJtlUYBRAVIVO POSTAI* CARDS.
i From The Boston Transcript.
An advertisement has appeared in some of the
daily papers In which a cosh payment has been
offered for uneancelled printed postal cards. It
seems that many business houses have occasion
j to have a large number of postal cards printed
to advertise some special line of goods or for
the use of some travelling man. For some rea?
son or other the conditions may change, so that
perhaps only half of the cards are use?), being
or m'.cd, Lbey can nut be used in any other way,,
j and the result is that in nine CSSSS out of ten
they are consigned to the waste basket, a? the
Government does not red. em uncancelled postal
cards an it does stamped envelopes.
A process has been discovered by which all of
the printed matter may be removed from the
card, leaving it in the same condition as when
bought at the poatofBcn. A charge of one-half
cent per card is- made for this work; or, in other
words, a man sends five hundred carda to be
"made over." The man who does the work
charges f?SO for his services, ami tin- u.?tomer
save? $1* ."?0, as the printed cards were of no uas
to him.</text>

	<text>THE BOSTON SUBWAY
SATISFACTORY SOLUTION OF THE
STREET CAR PROBLEM.
Contention of Trafllc In tli? Iluny Streets
of the Uub Relieved by Underground
Trolley Lines?Tunnels Tlmt Am Light,
Clean uud Attractive.
It is now possible to cross Tromont
street, Boston, at any point opposite tho
Common and at any time of day without
loss of life or limb. Tho new subway has
brought about tho change.
It 1 s an old tradition that tho fathers of
Boston, when thoy laid out tho city, let
the. streets follow the winding cow paths.
At any rate, the streets ius thoy exist today
urc very crooked and must of them aro
very narrow. This was all right in Revo?
lutionary times, but when the city grow
miles beyond tho Common und spread it?
self out to tho south and west; when busi?
ness centered itself along tbu lower ends
of Washington and Trentont streets, and
when dozens of street car tracks usurped
tho narrow roadways, then the Bostonlans
wished their ancestors bud not stuck so
closely to the cow paths.
Probably no other city on the continent,
was ever so badly allllctcd with a conges?
tion of trnllic as tho Hub haslieon for
many yea: Some of tho most important
street ear linen skirt tho south and east,
cornets ol the Common on Boylston mid
Tremont streets. When I he chango was
made hum hoc. epov.vr to trolley, matters
grew worse. Then tho poles and the tan?
gle of overhead wires made that historic.
breathing spot look liko a pieco of dingy,
green billiard cloth which had become fray?
ed and tuttered around the edges. So after
much wrangling in tho legislature and
courts it w;ls decided tu build the subway
and put the trolley cars underground.
A large portion of the work bus already
lieen accomplished and Boston is delight?
ed with the result. The first thing a Hus?
ton man asks a visitor from Now York,
Chicago or elsewhere is:
"Been through tho subway yet'/ Let's
see?you huven't one in your place, have
you?"
It is, in fact, a triumph of engineering
anil well worth a visit. Then! arc throe
open cut.s where tho trolley curs enter the
subway. One Is out on Tremont street
whore Shawmut avenue comes in. Hero
the tracks from each of those jmorough
fares dive into the tunnel. Another is In
the Public gardens, where the cars com?
ing down Boylston street take tho under?
ground tlip. The third is at tho northerly
end of the subway, just beyond-Hay mar?
ket square and in front of the new Union
terminal railroad station into which the
Fitchburg, Hoston und Maine, Eastern
und other roads run. Theru is u. loop hern
DOSTON'S NEW SUBWAY INCLINE IN THE Plin
LIC ns most of the t rolley lines inako it their
terminus, and, the subway being four
tracked, they disgorge their passengers
and take the back track up town.
Including the inclines or open onto, tho
subway has a total length of 1 miles and
will contain about live miles of track. At
present the branch down Boylston street
along the Common side and the main line
down Tremont to Park street are in oper?
ation. The Shawmut avenue branch and
tho northerly end of the main lino will be
finished within the next eight months.
Ground was broken for the subway in
April, 18115. The sum appropriated was
$7,ii(?0,000 and, wonderful to relate, tho
transit commissioners say that it is proba?
ble the cost will bo about $1,000,000 less
than that sum.
No groat difficulties have been encoun?
tered thus far in digging this big liplo In
the ground. Of course there were count?
less sewers, water pipes, gas pipes, electric
wire conduits and the like und some -III
inch water mains at an inconvenient level
proved rather hnrxl to handle, but n? un?
expected conditions arose to delay tho
work. The main trunk of the subway
runs under the wide walk or mall on tho
east side of the Common, anil when the
excavations were being made the bones of
hundreds of old Puritans were disturbed.
This raised a bowl of righteous Indigna?
tion,and the sncredness of the long forgot
burying ground was harped upon for
weeks. Hut the commissioners quieted
the reverent patriots by collecting nil tho
bones and roiuterrlng them in the holy
ground of the Common, with a nice monu?
ment to mark the spot.
The tleepest jioint of tho subway is on
Boylston street, where the south bound
t racks are laid lit) feet lielow the surface,
but the average depth is 14 feet. The tun?
nel itself is a giant bore with ribs of steel
mid casings! of cement, asphalt, concrete
and masonry. The roof is a series of
arches und the floor Is concave, with
drains at the bottom. As tho drnins are
below the level of the sewers, jilts have
been established at Intervals, and when
thev are filled with water automatic elec?
trical pumps are started, which empty
them Into tho sewers above.
Perhaps yon imagine that Boston's sub?
way is a tlark, damp, ill smelling place. It
is nothing of the sort. The entrances to
the stations aro handsome structures of
stone, with glass roofs. The only fault, to
be found with them is that thev remind

B9p The tunnel runs under Tremont street, and
HHk Its extensions are to go under Cornhlll, Han

i right through the denso business and shopping
districts, and thus securing every advantage
I that a road might have If It ran through Broad-
jf Tray, Fourteenth street and Twenty-third street,
i and part of Sixth avenue. And yet. In the face
j ef all these advantages, three months' experi
ence has shown that the Boston subway is not
popular, that people will not go Into It ex-
cept when they have to, and that the subway Is
lv a failure, save so far as It was a necosslty to re-
i'i Have the congestion of traffic on the street.
V XEED OF TUB BUDWAT.
A Bostonlans are proud of the subway. They
ri take strangers to see It, just as they take them
h to see Bunker IIIll Monument; make them ride
vM the length of It back and forth, and call alien
s' I tlon to all its fine foatures and then they keep
I away from it themsolves. Just as thoydofrom
if the monument. That this result ls of tntorest
I V to New Yorkers there can be no doubt. Tho
building of tbo subway growoutof a publloneed
Tfhloh was as absolute and pressing as the need
v ef this city for some addition to Its trafllo
in. facilities.
Hien, about ten years ago. the West End
oet Railway Company began to transform tho
horso car lines of Boston Into electric trot
lines the narrow streets In tho heart of
iton were already choked with tho dally rush
vehicles. Boston has to-day tho most ex
stve and comprehensive electrlo car system
the world. The added cars which wero re
red for tho now service fairly filled
i streets of the little central city
ere they were all concentrated. These
lines eorvo a suburban population of
trly a million persons, and it is possible to
;e a car for any part of the territory covered
.hoot going more thai a quarter of a mllo In
i city. Under a special act of the Lcglsla
e the Boston Transit Commission was ap
nted to devise a suitable means to relieve the
Station.
THE OrERATIVB COWTnAOT.
fader this commission tho subway wns
nned and is being built. Tho city of Boston
s for it and leases it to tho West End Street
llway Company for twenty years at an an
il rental which is not to be less than 4Ts per
it. upon the net cost of the tunnel, or more
,n .Ts per cent, upon tho sum of $7,000,000,
he tunnol should cost so much, and tho com
ly agrees to pay. in llou of interest, a toll of
nts for each car that passes through the
way. In caso the aggregate of tolls should
:eed the interest charges. The railroad com
ly cares for it, lights it, ventilates it, ana
ips It free from wator. i
fork was bosun on the subway on March 28,
13, and on Sept. 1 of this rear the first scc
o was put Into use. A second socllon was put
o use on Sept. 30. The main part of tbo sub
y now in use lies usdor Tremont street, bo
sen Park street and Boylst:n street. This
lion 'Is 1,700 feet long and contains four
cks. At both ends aro stations, built
nmodlously under ground and approached
m the surface by wide, easy stair

mental stone buildings. At the BoyI
in street station the tunnel divides into
o two-tracked sections. Ono of these con
ues under Tremont street for about 1,200
it, whon its comes to tho surfaco and empties
cars upon the tracks in Tremont street and
awmut avenue, which hero diverge. The
ler branch turns sharply to the wostward,
asunder the edge of tho famous Common, to
Public Oarden beyond Ohnrles street, where
comes to tho surfaco, 1,200 foet from the
ylston streot station, and its cars goon tholr
y down Boylston street,
man standahd or coxsTitucnos.
The tunnel Is kept almost as light as day
im end to end. At the stations It ls lined on
sides with enamelled white brick. Through
t its length and on tho codings at tho
itlons It Is pnlnted white. At tlio su
ns and through the tunnol electric

itnel, are the lights In tho passing cars, which
kept lit In making the tunnel passage. As

People doclare that they found the tunnel ro
ishlngly cool during the warm woather In Sep

lather they find It warm. No winds penetrato
and the moraont a porson gets to tho stairs at
itatlon he Is out of rench of storms. Only ono
jrce of discomfort has yet developed In tho

One thing to be seen from theso Ilguros," Mr.
Llttlo added, Is that tho sulmny, although It
runs pistn number of the principal theatres,
does not get any appreciable quantiij- of that
strictly fancy riding, tho people going homo
from tbo theatres, any more than It gets the
sboppors.
On rainy days ono would suppose that tho
subway would get n bigger proportion of trafllo
than in flno weather; but this ls not true. I
mot Mr. Dalton. ono of tho Transit Commission,
the other day when It wns mining, at tho en
trance to tho Park street station.
'"Isn't this chnrnilngl' he exclaimed as he
got In out of the storm.
"I admitted th-it It was; but when I camoto
look over tha tables of daily receipts and com
pare thom with the total tralllo I found that
although tho general trafllo had fallen off less
than 0 per cent, because of tbo rainy dny, tho
subway traffic had lost 30 per cent. This Is the
rooro significant from tho fact that one
half the former number of cars nro now oft tho
streets above."
A reference to tho dally tablos showed how
tho travel In the subway fell off In unpleasant
weather. On Nor. 2, when tho usual dally
Irrffllc was 22,000 or 23,000 persons, only
14.000 went through tho subway. On Nov. 2a
tho number roll to 13,000, while tho next dny It
roso to 24,000. On Sundays, when tho tratllc
on nil parts of tho system ls fancy riding prin
cipally, tho number of passongers who go
through tbo subway falls as low as 0,000.
FACT8 FOR NEW YORK TO 1-0NDER,
These aro tho facta. If It wcro possible to
build tbo long tunnel proposed for this city nnd
mal.o all parts of It ns perfect ns tho Boston
subway, which is at least doubtful, what would
be thn effect of an oqual Indisposition of Now
Yorkers to using it upon tho chances of Its pay
ing I Tho proposed road would have enough to
contend with through tho location of its main
linos out of tho way of tho short-ride local
business, out of which alone profit ls to
be made; but If the fancy traffic avoided It, ns
It avoids the lloston subway, tho result would
bo ruinous, Tho contractors would find them
selves with no ono to carry except tho people
who wanted to ride to Harlem and far above
or to Klngsbrldge, all for fire cents, and. what
ever forfeit they had to make, they would soon
abandon tho lino for thn city to operate at a loss.
CACHES OF rUPLIC PREJUDICE.
Why the peoplo avoid tho subway Is a ques
tion much discussed. Perhaps as good nn ex
planation ns anr Is to bo found in a conversa
tion which took place between Tun Sun re
porter who gathered these fncts nnd the pretty
&lrl who Owns the news stnnd at one of Boston's
est hotels.
"Ilavo you beon through the subway yet I"
ho asked enthusiastically.
"Yes," the reporter nnswored.
"I have just been through It, Isn't It grand!"
she exclaimed.
"l)o you go through it of ten I" asked tho re
porter curiously.
"Ob, no!" Bho answered. "I think It's beau
tiful, so light, and dry, and comfort bio: but I
always take a surfaco car. I think I hate to
walk up the stairs, although I am not lazy. I
walk clear out to ltoxbury and back almost
ever' day, and have lost slxteon pounds by
doing so, but, somehow, I don't llko to go up and
down stairs In tho subway."
It ls probably something more than this thnt
deters people from going underground even In a
tunnel bo well lighted. It is well known thnt
the underground roads In London do not pay,
nnd this ls duo largely to tho lack of tho fnncy
trafflc, such as overflows surface lines and ele
vated roads In New York. Ask a Londoner If
he uses tho underground roads in his own city
much, and IiIb answer Is almost suro to bo:
"Oh, yes, but only when lhavo to."
NOW BOSTON WANTS AN ELEVATED ROAD.
That Boston has awakened to the fact that
subways arc not n good thing whero they can be
avoided. Is clear from the character of tho very
latest move now on foot there. This ls to build
elevated railroads from tho ends of the subway,
nnd thus, in thoopen air, enrry tho cars out be
yond the thickly built-UD sections to Rnx
bury, Cambridge, Cbarlestown, and be
jond. This plan ls to be carried out ns
soon as tho Stato Railroad Commission agrees
to a lease of the West End road's lines to the
new elevated railroad company.</text>

into a panic nnd paralyzed trnfflc ln

No one know the trouble. Elevatcd

from tlie cars to the surfacc.
Tralnmen nnd statlon pollce at
tempted to call the flrd departmont
and found tho telephones so charged
wlth clectrlclty as to be useless.
Mnny of the women reachlng the

were overcomo by the smoko, falnted,
nnd had to be dragged to the surfnce.
Several becanio hysterlcal and woro

by tho smoko and becomlng electro

Tralnmaster Benjamln wns the flrst
offlclal to reach the Boylston street
statlon and to brlng some sort of or-
der out of tho cliaos. Enterlng the
subway along the llne of the north
bound cars he made hla way some 100
feet to the south of tlie statlon and
found the cause of the trouble.
The feed cables for the thlrd rall,
runnlng between the ralla and en
closed ln four-inch wooden box con
dults, were found grouuded and
throwlng off flashes of electrlclty,
whlch llluminnted the subway for
tnany hundreds of feet. The electrl
clty had jumped to other cables run
nlng parallel, and even charged the
wnlla of the subway. Ten powerful
cables felt the lnftuence of the crosn
nnd were cracklng nnd throwlng off
flames and flashes of llght, threaten
Ing death to any who cnme near.
Tho wooden box condtilt, black and
greasy and very Inflammable, was

Three persons were hurt, nnd all of

for anyone, however famlllar ylth the

whlch flllcd every foot of space be

As Chlef Mullen's men toucbed the
walls thoy felt a shock at once. The

Ihey carrled became charged, and wlth
electrlclty runnlng up thelr arms the
men hcsltated for a mlnute for orders

Half an hour was consumed ln put

Both Chlef Mullen and Aaslstant

	<text>BOSTON'S FAMOUS SUBWAY
CHIEF EXUlXliKK CAHSOX 3BI.IS
HOW IT IS COXSTIIVC1HD,
Lecture Before Engineers' Club Feature
of the Kuglnoeiiiig Work on the Subway
Subways In Other Cities.
An exceedingly Interesting and valu
able lecture was given last evening In
North Sheffield hall by Howard A. Car
son, member of the American Society
of Civil Engineers and chief engineer
of the famous Boston subway. The
lecture was given, under the auspic&i
of the Engineers' club and was largelj
attended by citizens as well as stu
dents. Professor DuBols Introduced Mr. Car
son, who spoke on "Subways in Bos
ton, London and Elsewhere." The lec
ture was illustrated by stereopticon
views of the Boston subway and also
of some of the European subways
which Mr. Carson has visited.
The lecturer at the commencement
explained why the Boston subway was
built. "The DODulatlon of Boston 130
years ago was less than 22,000; 100 years
ao about 26,000; In 1830, in the remem
brance of many, about 82,000, while to
day the city has about 600,000. The
population of Boston doubles In about
thirty-five years.
"The use o the streets for travel In
creases faster In proportion than the
population of the city. In 1896 167,000,000
persona were carried by the street rail
ways. While the population doubles
only in twenty-flve years, travel on the
street railways doubles In about ten
years.
"The streets are no wider now than
they were one hundred years ago, and
they are not able to do the work they
are needed to do. If streets can't do
the work required of them the natural
thing to do is to build them wider or
make new streets, but the cost is too
great for this, costing perhaps $100 a
foot. If you can't Wld or.broaden the
old streets you must do the way a per
son does when a house la overcrowded
and has not land to build new by add
ing stories to the old. In the case of a
street you have to decide between an
elevatedway or a subway.
"The mere cost of erecting an elevat
ed road is only about one-half or one
third of that of a eubway, but the dam
age which has to be paid to adjacent
property owners makes the cost of the
two systems about the same. As to the
convenience and comfort of the two
methods, different persons are likely to
hold different views."
Mr. Carson then explained an elevat
ed road which Is being constructed in
Germany, where the cars are suspended
from the track Instead of running on
the raila.
"The Boston subway is being built
under some of the most traveled streets
of the city. For most of the distance it
is to have two tracks, but at points
there are four tracks where the cars
can run back without naming to the
end of the line. At the northern termi
nus there is an incline where the cars
i can come to the surface. Stations for
passengers are placed at convenient
distances, usually one In about 1,000
feet.
"The retaining walls of the subway
are of granite and concrete, mostly of
concrete. There are two forms of con
struction employed in the roof, one
made of steel and concrete and the oth
er the brick arch.
"The subway is about twenty-four
feet in width at the Incline, where there
are two tracks, and about sixteen feet
high. In the middle of the subway is a
drain, the side wa!! of which, are of
brick with open Joints, so that thfe wa
ter can eaeily find its way Into It, and
the top is covered over with flags eas
ily removed if the drain needs inspec
tion or repair.
"At the passenger stations there are
two stairways, each fifteen feet In
width. It was not Intended at first to
use elevators at all, but It may be
thought desirable to adopt them at
some stations later on.
'In the work of construction many
pipes were encountered which had to
be removed or passed under. The work
is being so performed as to cause the
least possible hindrance to travel on
the streets. In the daytime one-third
of the street is occupied for the. plant
and material used for the work, and
the other two-thirds Is left for travel.
At night about two-thirds of the street
is occupied in the work.
'Bridges are built over the excava
tions on a level with the street, so that
one passing over them will hardly no
tice the fact. The work Is done by
what is known as the slice method, by
which ten or a dozen sections are being
excavated at the same time, no two be
ing adjoining.
'There are eight fans placed at ap
propriate Intervals to ventilate the tun
nel, each fan being seven feet in diam
eter. It was feared by some that the
excavations would weaken the founda
tions of some of the high buildings, but
the work has so far advanced now that
there is seen to be no danger."
Mr. Carson olosed his lecture with a
rapid description of subways in Buda
pest, Paris, London and Glasgow, and
also a description of the use of the
shield In tunnelling.</text>

Make Indians Wild
Again, Says Pastor
Philadelphia, Jan. 21.—Modern
jazz music and dancing are making
the Indians wild again. The roll of
the snare drum and the wail of the
saxophone, combined with the "tod

memories of the tom-tom and the

So asserted Dr. Henry Beets of

	<text>The Origin of Jazz
(BY MADGE R. CAYTON)
Just what is jazz? One has a vague idea of a dis
orderly number of sounds played entirely for dancing.
But jazz has a far deep.r significance. It is an attempt
to reproduce the marvelous syncopation of the African
Jungle. It is the result of the savage musican's won
derful gift of progressive retarding and acceleration
which is guided by his sense of ewing. He who would
play ja^z nnut have rhythmic aggressiveness. As one
iran put it, ja: z music is the rtelirum tr mens of suyco
pL.i'on. It n strict rhythm without melody.
The words ja;, jazz, jazz, J&3Z, and jascz are of
Afrcan origin but come direct form the Creole patois
and idiom meaning "speed things up." For in th> old
plantation days when the slaves were having one of their
rare holidays an fun would languish, some West Coast
African would say, "jazz hdT up," and then things would
go fast and furious. Today "jazz her up," is still a
slang expression with the same meaning.
There are two types of jazz: One originating in
China, which is called Siames 3 music, and the other
originating in Africa having only a general name of
jazz applied to it. Since the Siamese music or Oriental
jazz, as it is often called, stay:d strictly in China and
underwent no futher development it is not important.
But the jazz that originated in Africa, or the Occidental
jazz is known the world ov-r and because of its impor
tance w> will trace its growth only.
Occidental jazz first came to life on the West Coast
of Africa. There big sturdy warriers danced to tli? music
of throbbing Tom —Toms while the entire jungle was
the accompanying orchestra.
Then it spread, reaching Cuba thru deported slaves.
It found a rich soil there for its growth, since the
jungles of Africa were not so different from the swamps
of Cuba. All of that "Hula Hula stuff," goes straight
back to Africa for its origin. Then jazz was transplanted
into America, entering from the south and creeping
up until it covered all of America. About that time the
war broke out and when our boys went to Europe and
and especially to France they took their beloved jazz
with them. So Paris was initiated into a new world of
music over which they promptly went wild.
But jazz has found her strongest support in the
United States. When jazz arived in America via New
Crleans it almost died leaving only a little spark fostered
by the slaves and New Orleans underworld. For years
jazz has ruled the New Orleans underworld resorts,
thei>- natrons dancing to jazz for gladsome generations
Ragtime and the new dances came from there. Then
slowly, little by little, jazz crept up the Missippi from
resort to resort until it landed in Chicago at Freiburg's
whither it had been proceded by stanzas of "Must I
Hesitate"? "The Blues", 'Frankie and Johnnie," and
other classics of the levee underworld that seems to
please the savage part of us. From there it spread
like wild fire all over the United States, hitting the
Middle West the hardest and the extreme East the
lightest. Jazz has reigned supreme for some years and
CAYTON'S MONTH! V
most likely, will reign for many more for it has invaded
our dance halls, theaters, and concert halls. Even our
churchs have not escaped without their share of tem
petious music. It has even snatched our very song»,
classical and popular, and taken them for its own use
ragging them to death.
One use to think of a band as a group of respectable
looking beings usally with a splendid musical ability.
But when one gazes upon a jazz band he sees a bunch of
s .emingly demented men, contorting themselves and
their instruments far better than a St Vitis dancer.
For the modern jazz band is in reality a young army
artillery. The howitzers of the band ara stationed in
the trap drum, snare drum, cymbals, triangle, wooden
blocks, xylophone, cow bells, rattles and whistles for
the production of various weried noises. The trome
bones represent the field guns, the clarinets, oboes,
saxophones, auto homes and cornets furnish thol rapid
lire batteries. The range being point blank one can
easily s^e why the effect of the drum fire is so complete.
Some say that jazz is sensual. If so why has it
lived in America so long? For this reason: Jazz is of
tho ravage and therefore clemntal in its appeal. It is
bouterous, rough, but the very soul of kindly good
humor and care free merriment. It is the music siren
of the dance for while one is swept thru a neck breaking,
whirl-wind measura his own cares and responsibilities
are brushed aside. In America especially because we,
;00, are of a strenous nature, we nejd and must find
some sort of energetic exercise as a conteractant. The
old fashioned, dreamy waltez and graceful, measured
minuets are things of the past. The tired business man,
the worn out mother, the discouraged poet, as well as
the impatient youths, seek and find relief in jazz. Then
ddi not th dough boys find a wonderful solace in their
beloved jazz? For while under its throes they forgot
the bloody battle field, the stench of decaying bodies;
they even forgot there was such a thing as war. Then
jazz is d mocratic. It is simple enough for any one to
understand and enough of a vampire to coax every one
into a world of oblivion. Can we not then say that jazz
has existed for a purpose and has truly fulfilled that
purpos;.?
But on the other hand one must be careful that the
alluring god of jazz, Mumbo Jumbo, does not lead us so
far from the true god of music, Pan, that we fail to
appr ciate the real classic. Might not one thus uncon
sciouly sell his birth-right for a mess of pottage?
Because jazz is elemental bringing the savage to the
curface, it is dang rous. We cannot afford in our
present stage of civilization to accept the standard of
the savage even if it is only thru the giddy measure of
a dance. True jazz belongs to the "forest primeval"
and is mor: real and refined there than in a hall filled
with dancer.3. The very fact that the growth of jazz
las been thru the under world resorts of America is a
E rong po'nt in i's disfavor. In embrasing what we
now c..11 a necessary evil is there not a chance of jazz

Jazz Responsible for
Most of the Evils,

By Wilbur Forrest
JAZZ," that root of much
evil in music, a menace to
established rythmical law
and order and beauty and
grace, is dying its slow but natural
death
Syncopation which tends ^toward
"shimmying," wriggling and hop?
ping about dance floors as in the
days cf prehistoric barbarism is dis?
appearing and, according to those
authorities who make it their busi?
ness to study dancing, the demise of
"jazz" occasions more general joy
than sorrow. Puritanical grand?
mothers and perhaps less prudish
fathers and mothers who attend and
chaperon social dances of the young
need not much longer blush when
their eyes sweep the ballroom. The
youth of the nation may, after all,
grow up amidst less sensuous music
and dancing positions which em?
barrass their elders. A reaction
against this sort of thing is in full
swing in the United States and, like
a burned out plague, "jazz" music
and "jazz" dancing are leaving us.
While "jazz"' still retains its ad?
mirers and supporters, its own
ridiculousness has done more toward
it? eliminatii n than any other agen?
cy, believes Fenton T. Bott, presi?
dent of the American National As?
sociation, Masters of Dancing, who
is now in New York to attend the
thirty- annual convention of
that association, beginning August
25, at the Hotel Astor.
For Clean Dancing
The association, with it? more
than five hundred active members in
every city cf any r-ize in the UYiited
States and Canada, has been one of
the agencies working quietly since
the advent of "jazz" to keep danc?
ing clean and moral. In coopera?
tion with many civic and welfare so?
cieties throughout the country, much
has been done to eliminate the sala
ciou: and immoral features which
this form of syncopation brought
he dance floor.
"We do not recognize the terrr
'jazz,' which is purely a coined
word," Mr. Bot; told The Tribune
"We ever, recognize synco
d.we have nothing agai?.si
of syncopated music.
It can be playi i so brilliantly if
played right, and then again it can
ther form so sensu?
ous and evil that it harks clear back
to the wild and irresponsible barba?
rism of the dark ages. We have
tried and preach modera?
tion. Civilization has begun to re?
volt against the wrong kind of syn?
copation, tins so-called 'jazz,' whicr
during tne more unrestrained perioc
of the war swept the country witl
a crop of immodesty in both son?
and dance in its wake. It first ap
peared on the stage, and eventually
it audaciously entered the publi;
dance hail and private ballroon
alike.
"There is a decided upward tren?
in music now, as compared with i
year ago," continued the dance mas
ter president. "New York, a leade
in entertainment whose example i
followed everywhere, is setting
cleaner pace. Compare New York'
roof gardens of some of the leadin?
hotels, compare the theaters, th
moving picture palaces and even th
dance halls now with a year age

Written and distributed to every cot

There has been virtually no op?
position to the anti-jazz campaign
waged by his organization except
from a few unscrupulous dance hall
proprietors, said the president.
"Dancing is an essential," he
added. "What would tens of thou?
sands of people do nightly in New
York if they were not permitted to
go somewhere, meet socially, and
dance? If the places where these
people meet are decent there can be
no finer, more healthful or enjoy?
able recreation anywhere."
"What do you consider good or
bad positions in dancing?" he was
asked.
"It is difficult to illustrate posi?
tions," he answered. "Anyone can
see with a glance over the dance
floor wdiether positions are good or
bad. When you take hold of a girl
to dance, common sense and decency
should prompt your position. If your
attitude toward her is proper, you
will not crush your body against
hers nor place your cheek against
hers.
A Form of Exercise
"Clean dancing is an efficient
form of exercise, amusement and
recreation for both sexes. It devel?
ops muscle coordination which re?
sults in grace of movement. Girls
run, roll hoops and skip the rope
during their more youthful years
but later their play becomes more
sedentary, and should be supple?
mented by class exercises and
games. Dancing is one of these.
Dancing is likewise a mind quicken
er. By fixing the attention, bringing
to bear the force of will on the com?
plicated actions of the body, it edu?
cates the mental faculties. This is
especially true of aesthetic dancing,
during the performance of which
the muscles of the arms and trunk
are used, as well as those of the
legs.
"Sometimes the dancing school is
misunderstood," continued the mas?
ter. "The dishonest and unscrupu?
lous dance hall proprietor may give
the clean dancing academy a bad
name, just as some classes of thea?
ters may give the theater a bad
name. The theater is a great insti?
tution, but it is all wrong from the
wrong standpoint. The same is true
of dancing and dancing schools. The
wrong angle may be applied to them
just as to the theater.
To Ask Church's Aid
The American National Associa?
tion during its coming convention in
New York will renew a long-studied
effort to gain the cooperation of the
Methodist Church in the promotion
of clean dancing. This denomina?
tion takes a stand in its "blue laws"
against dancing in any form, and
during the last General Conference,
some years ago, a resolution to
amend the "blue laws" was voted
down. A group of "progressive"
Methodists, led by J. Henry Smythe,
of New York, is to-day avowedly in
favor of dancing, and will carry the
fight into the next Methodist General
Conference. The "conservatives"
are said to be adamant in their re?
fusal to lift a ban prescribed almost
half a century ago on many forms of
amusement.
"Dancing is older than Christi?
anity," said the president of the
dancing masters. "It will live so
long as there is music. It is our
struggle to keep this form of amuse?
ment clean and moral, and we feel
that the Methodist Church can do
more for humanity by helping us
than by opposing dancing in general.
It is only the older and more con?
servative Methodists who now op?
pose dancing. Younger Methodists
favor it."
Allied with the dancing masters'
organization against what is termed
improper music and dancing, many
social and civic societies have
been doing their part. A pamphlet
issued by the organization, contain?
ing "Rules, Regulations and Sugges?
tions Governing S^pcial Dancing,"
j has been distributed by the thousand
^y social welfare societies and the
H-elfare department of the United
States government. Universities
and colleges, demanding authorita?
tive knowledge on proper and im?
proper dancing during school func?
tions, have beer, supplied with these
rules and regulations almost every
where in the United States.
The Actors' Eejuity Association,
?m organization composed of thou?
sands of actors and actresses, is an
able element allied against forms of
music and dancing which might tend
toward a bad effect on the general
public.
The dancing masters have success?
fully solicited the cooperation of
"^ong publishers, who have in turr?
i toned down suggestive titles and
Mthographs on sheet music. Phonr?
graph companies, spending tens o?
thousands of dollars monthly in
j brightly colored magazines, have
been prevailed upon to make their
advertising less "jazzy."
The General Federation of Worn
j en's Clubs, one of the most active
agencies in the United States, is
working for music reform. At the
biennial conference in June at D.es
Moines a resolution was passed con?
demning popular songs which smack
of vulgarity and initiating an open
campaign for better American music.
Mrs. Marx E. Oberndorf er (Anne
Shaw Faulkner), cf Chicago, wife
of the famous pianist, selected na
tional music chairman, is to-day
planning and directing the music
activities of more than 19,000 wom?
an's clubs. By means of music mem
ory contests in schools, churches, de?
partment stores, industries and in?
stitutions and the establishment of
i community music centers, she plans
to save a nation threatened by
"jazz" and "ragtime."

"All exaggerated movements, espe?

dancing with their faces together
show such extreme* bad taste that
it should be unnecessary even to call
attention to it."
"All in all," says President Fenton
Botts, "the campaign has done much
to cleanse modern dancing, but
'jazz,' the root if it all, has done
more to eliminate itself than all the
campaigns.
"The American 'jazz' craze has
been like a popular celebration?for
a day or two all is enthusiasm, flags
and speeches. Soon it wanes and

Jazz, he believes, is now dying

any of the little measures we tread
seemed like mere minuets.
But the French, it appears, think dif
ferently on that subject.
The "Revue Mondiale," influential
Paris paper, has got together a mass
of opinions on American dance steps
which is not at all flattering. In fact,
some of them might be called damning
and others of them shouldn't really be
printed.
Regina Badct, who appears on the
stage and dances in a string or so of
beads and a few bracelets, goes on rec
ord as saying that the American stylo
of dancing is to be condemned for its
sensuousness.
Modern dancing is low and ugly, Abel
Hermant says. Victor Marguerite terms
it "a precocious and dangerous de
floration." B. Baudrillart. of the Acad
emy, admits that reaction from the
war is some excuse, but is much worried
at the effect of the craze for dancing at
all hours. One correspondent branded
dancing as "a hypocritical form of ob
taining Illicit pleasure Medical ver-
Their Blare As "Ugly, Ridiculous and Mra' 1
Indecent," but the Public Refuses M I

an jazz has so captivated all France th
diets handed down by mental specialists,
surgeons, nerve specialists and others
condemn the dancing of to-day as very
bad for the moral welfare, as well as
for the future of the race.
"And it comes from America," they
end up by saying, accusingly.
"Look at that new dance, the 'Balan
cello,' that came from Genoa around the
time of the conference, and was about
the only thing that happened then," the
French cry. "It's a one-step and a
shiver combined. Terrible! Even though
the Americans wouldn't come to Genoa,
we are willing to wager they sent that
dance."
There's no telling where the craze will
end, if you believe the French papers
At the head of this page is
reproduced a famous French
artist's very sarcastic com- .gg
ment on the absurd lengths to &0&
which he thinks the Amcri-
cans have carried their acro
batic dances. He pictures six dances
which, if not already in vogue, he be
lieves soon will be.
No. 1 is what he calls the Jugglers'
Jazz. It is a trifle wearing on the back
of the neck, but it does leave the feet
so free.
Then there is the Upside-Down Camel
Walk, in which the couple is shown in
the act of reversing.
No. 8 is the Back-to-Back Fox Trot.
Even more criticism than was aroused
by the cheek-to-cheek dancing may bo
occasioned by this back-to-back stuff.
Next comes the Marine Glide, a step
which it will not be wise to indulge in
for at least one hour after eating.
No. 5 is the Tipsy-TojiBy Toddle, a
combination of the shimmy, the Chicago
and the giant swing.
The last is a novelty which the artist
christens the Lunch Counter Whirl.
But the French are not all taking the
American manner of tripping it on the
light fantastic toe in such a light fan
tastic mood. Some are treating it in
what they consider a spirit of stark,
grim realism. There's Paul Bourget, of
the French Academy, for instance, who
has announced that his next novel is to
deal with the adventures of a young girl,
who, smitten by the microbe of the
dance, is dragged down and down as if
by drink.- "Dope" and the gigolos, or.
professional dancing men, then compass
her ruin.
Abel Hemant hesitates to subject
the characters in his novels to the
tango, maxixc and fox trot. "These so-

A number of French scien
tists and savants whose words carry
weight all have uttered words of cau
tion against the harm to the moral wel
fare of the nation which may result
from the physical excitement engendered
by the styles of modern dancing. Mme.
Augustin Lofert, whose husband direct
ed the French Academy of the Dance,
deplores cheek-to-cheek dancing, hug
ging and wrestling holds. Maurice Level
sees peril in the habit of women in leav
ing off their cornets for a dance.

f oust jazz and
'-r the dances it
inspires has been im
y puted to as high a per-
sonage in France as
Premier Poincare, who is said to
haye been prompted to the under
taking by the municipal council.
Among those complaining have been the
French musicians who have been losing
employment because of the prevalence
of the darkey jazz bands. The banjo
and the saxophone have superseded the
violin and the flute, Only negroes are
considered to be the proper performers
on jazz instruments, and restaurants and
dance halls will employ only them. It
is called the "Black Peril."
Yet in spite of this general condem
nation of the American jazz dances,
thoir hold on the French public grows
stronger and stronger.
Dance places are springing up like
mushrooms and their number never
seems to decrease. Maurice and Hughes
have opened a new palace on the Rue
Cammartin. The "So Different" and the
floors at the Carlton, the Claridgc, the
Scheherazade, Mirabeau and Ba1 Bul
lier all are crowded.
It has come to be pretty well under
stood in Paris that if you do not shake
a mean foot, you had better learn, for
a wallflower has a better time Staying
at home and knitliner.
A new dancing place is said to open
every week, and even at that the
after-theater crowds have difficulty in
finding dancing space and that in
spite of the fact that modern dancing
takes so little space.
There are attempt? to introduce
l ew steps, but all of them are vain
unless they bring new innovations in
American jazz. And those seem to be
forthcoming from time to time, al
though American reformers are rav
ing and legislators uselessly intro
duce bills that attempt to prescribe
the holds to be used in our
dancing and the distance to
be kept.
The American brand of
jazz dancing continues to be 9

  Immoral Dances; Jazz Craze Must Go
Appeal Made to Musicians to
Chaperones Included in Warning.
Th danolng that ha been Indulged
In at some of the public dancing hall
In Chattanooga haa been the subject
of much comment lately. Orchestra
leader are beginning to think that
unless they feature that "Jazs Blues"
they will not be popular. The young
girl who attend these dance, ac
cording to those who are best In
formed are beginning to feel the same
way. In other word, the danolng
publlo ha gone "Jazx mad."
The first step to take In order to
reform the publlo dancing hall," ac
cording to Al Wilson, of the Wilson
Dancing achool, "1 to have strict
rule in these publlo places, and to
have some one there to see that they
are enforced." Mr. Wilson states
that while the average person dances
for the love of dancing, on the other
hand there are some who dance only
for the opportunity of coming In
close contact with those of the op
posite sex. For thin reason, Mr. Wll
on ayi, the hugging and cheek-to-cheek
dancing must go. He says
that the time ha come when the
people must take a stand against all
!:lnd of (Immoral dancing. He
print out that the lover of dancing
do not necessarily have to go back
to th ancient dancing, for the mod
ern dances, If danced properly, are far
more attractive and graceful. He
state that even "the )nzz" fox trot
with the tickle-toe can be danced In
a moral way. But unfortunately the
average young couple, he adds, danc
ing the fox trot, very closely resemble
Jclly-ln-a-bowl on a frosty morning.
The dancing- master continued "Some
of our best girls dance this way be
cause they think It la 'stylish.' They
mean absolutely no harm, but think
to be popular they must rub all the
skin oft the left side of their face
against the wiry beard of some young
man. How some people can dance
all hugged up I past me; fact Is,
they don't dance, they Just hop.
Notice a couple of real dancer on
exhibition, and you will see at least
four Inches of space between them.
That Is the real comfortable way to
dance. You must be educated In
proper dancing." x
Warming to hi subject, Mr. Wil
son says: "We appeal to mothers
and chaperones to help us elevate
dancing. We also appeal to musi
cians. They do not realize how much
help they can be. The way Is to cut
out so much "Jazz" and play the

controversy over jazz has burst forth
in New York as the result of a recent
play by J. Hartley Manners, called
"The National Anthem," which treats
of the baleful effects of syncopation.
Jazz, according to those who champion
Mr. Manners' view, is a national curse
which is wickedly leading wholesome
Americans astray, while its defenders
insist that it is nothing more than a
pleasant, if banal form of amusement
and a healthful stimulating exercise.
Although this sudden assault upon
our one conspicuous contribution to
music may appear a trifle late now
that jazz in itB wildest state has passed
on to Europe and has been replaced
by a more refined phase over here, the
reform element is making the most of
it. A bill attempting to regulate
modern dancing and dance music has
recently been introduced into the New
York legislature, and will doubtless be
vigorously pushed through the law
making machinery in the near future.
Meantime, New Yorkers of prominence
including many in the theater and in
the pulpit, are eloquently voicing their
views on the subject.
"My objection to jazz." says Miss
Laurette Taylor, whose talent and
charming personality are making her
husband's play, "The National An
them" a great success, "is that one
can't sit still when it is played. You
just must get up and wear yourself
out dancing. When you become accus
tomed to the pronounced rhythm you
are unable to get that beautiful re
laxation which comes from the appre
ciation of fine music. ïhis is really
doing a terrible injury to young peo
ple."
Miss Ida M Tarbell, well known
author, holds a somewhat similar view.
"Jazz is to me a very irritating
thing," she declares. "It assaults the
nerves and dulls the brain. 1 do not
see how it can fail to have a demoral
izing effect if one subjects one's self
to it constantly. Drink is its natural
accompaniment. I have been across the
continent five times, and everywhere
on the streets and in the hotels I have
heard it. One could dance a great deal
to harmonious music, I should think,
and not have this terrible nervous ex
citement. But jazz is not music."
Jazz Cuts Down Booze
On the other hand Miss Margaret
Hawkeswortb, dance organizer, asserts
that jazz serves a high and noble pur
pose in diverting people and thus keep
ing them out of trouble. "I believe
that people would all drink more with
out. it,'' she says. "I see no connection
between jazz and drink except that if
there were nothing to do in the evening
people would be more likely to sit
around and drink. Jazz goes through
all classes of our national life and I
think it is here to stay. It is a god
send for both upper and lower classes."
This opinion is echoed 0 y Mrs.
Charles Tiffany, prominent New York
matron, who says: "It seems to me that
dancing has done more good than harm.
Older people exercise as they never did
before. People are more sociable,
more human. And after all. jazs af
fects only a fraction of the population.
Eighteenth century drawing rooqis
were just as much shocked by the waltz
aud other so-called round dances as we
are today at the ultra-modern steps
that accompany jazz music."
A nerve specialist quoted by a New
York newspaper considers jazz very
bad for the world in general, while a
well-known priest declares it as "rot
ten," leading to "all sorts of lascivious
dancing ana destroying whatever taste
for good music there might be."
Irving Berlin, who has made a fort
une in composing jazz hits, naturally
defends the product. "We live in a
jazz age," he points out, "and if you
don't like jazz you are out of tune with
the times. And a majority of people
must like it or it wouldn't be univer
sal throughout America, as it most cer
tainly is. Music reflects the thoughts
and habits of the people. There is
more freedom in social customs now.
Young women go about alone, everyone
is more independent, and all this is "duly
reflected in the music of the day."
Better Than Sentimentaltty
At least one serious composer also,
Miss Rebecca Clark, a young woman
whose compositions for the viola have
attracted favorable attention, takes a
generous view of jazz. "I like it for its
rhythm." she says, "and I consider it
better than the mawkish sentimentality
of the English ballads. At the last
analysis, jazz is only primitive rhythm
and in a way that is its trouble. It
makes a primitive appeal. Harmony
combined with rhythm gives us some
thing else to respond to and brings out
emotions of a different kind.'
In Europe, jazz is much more high
ly regarded than in this country, al
though its widespread popularity has
not been viewed by the bourgeoisie
without a storm of scared protest
Over there, however, it has aroused
much interest among nerious musicians
who at least respect originality. And
that jazz is an American product, in
spite of its supposed jungle origin, can
not be denied.
"But," says one European authori
ty. "if your serious American com
posers, through excess culture, con
tinue to ignore or sneer at jazz, they
may miss a very valuable opportunity
—the opportunity of initiating the next
great revolution in music. We may
discover over here that jazz will fur
nish to European music that infusion
of new blood and strength that is now
so necessary to its very life. In that
event, it may return to you Americans
disguised as 'modern music' with the
stamp of European approval which—
pardon me—seems so necessary to
your cultured classes in the United
States. In other words, what you now
despise and reject as vulgar, cheap and
contemptible, your musicians may ac
claim when eventually it reappears un
der a European label."
How Jazz Started
Meanwhile, jazz is undergoing a re
form in this country. It started out
in California a few years ago when a
young musician in the San Francisco
Symphony orchestra decided that he
wanted to get married, and that in or
der to accomplish the feat he would
have to have larger income than his
symphony salary. There was only one
thing for him to do—to take up dance
music. He did; and since then jazz
has never been the same. As a trained
way, much might be done to im
prove many factories, apecially
those engaged in industries of the
finer sort, where unjaded nerves
have the greatest economic value.
City life as a whole is still barbar
ously noisy and in some respects
perhaps grows worse, but the age
which has seen the advent of the
rubber tirt and the noiseless motor
may witness further developments
which will make the modern city a
fitter place for human existence."
and highly accomplished musician, he
began taking all the popular "blues"
songs and skillfully arranging them for
orchestration.
The average popular song consists
of merely one melody which is simply
repeated over and over again. Occa
sionally, at very rare intervals, a pop
ular song writer may grow extravagant
and combine a couple of melodies, but
this is regarded as unnecessarily
wasteful The one melody of the popu
lar song is the same as the theme of
classical music. Paul Whiteman was
the first to conceive the idea of taking
this one jazz melody and filling in the
gaps between its occurrence with
counter melodies. First comes a dra
matic introduction leading up to the
jazz melody, while after that each time
the melody occurs it is preceded by a
bit of—say a Liszt rhapsody or a
Chopin mazurka—^possibly even a dif
ficult passage by Bach.
According to Mr. Whiteman, this
task, which is now being followed by
nearly all the leaders of American
dance orchestras, is one which should
not incur the scorn of good musicians.
"All classical music," ne says, "con
sists, in the final analysis, of the folk
themes of peasants which have been
built into sophisticated art. With the
possible exception of McDowell and
Cadmen, our dance music has thus far
been America's one original contribu
tion to the music of the world. Our
other music has been the result of
European influences. And Europe
gives us credit for our contribution.</text>

	<text>Negro Gl’s Helping
To Win Jazz Fans
In Germany
Frankfurt, Germany Mar. 15—
American Negro soldiers joined
with a few youthful Germans,
are winning friends for “swing”
and jazz music in Germay.
Real American jazz has few
friends in this country of Bach,
Beethoven, Handel, and Wagner,
fans have formed “hot clubs" in

Frankfurt has the oldest club

as Manager. Bohlaender, an old
timer in German jazz circles and
a recognized jazz teacher spent
two years in the United States
studying jazz from 1937 to 1939.
There is hardly a jam session
jn the Frankfur tHot Club with
out an American audience. Negro
soldiers of the American occupa

sional musicians often join the
band and “paint the house red,"
the club manager said
“Jazz is the most democratic
thing on earth," Bohlaender said
“because it teaches people of dif

each other’s thoughts and opin

	<text>Says Ellington
Music 'Hybrid,'
Too Complex
l akes Crack
At Some Of His
Current Stars
By PAUL DANIEL DAVIS
BOSTON— (ANF)—Duke Elling
ton attracted a great mob to
Symphony hall in Boston on Sun
day night, with a thousand being
turned away. The Ellington con
cert in Boston was a difficult one
one to evaluate, with the band as
polished as ever, but Duke under
going a major change.
His compoitions and orchestra
tions become more and more com
plex, and he is turning to the mod
ern school of composition, retain
ing at the same time, much of I'ne
form of jazz, resulting in a unique
hybird. “New World A-Comin,’’
namer for Roi Ottley’s book of the
same name, seemed out of line as
a jazz composition, and not sat
is factory from any other standard.
The Piano interludes and clarinet
cadenza, particularly, had nothing
to do with jazz and nothing to do
with the rest of the composition.
MUSIC PERSONAL
As a known, Ellington’s music has
always been a very personal matter,
as far as he and his musicians
were concerned. Most of the ma
terial was developed by the entire
band, and only a few compositions
could truly be considered the sole
w»ork of any one man. The band
had an exceptionally stable per
sonnel between 1927 and 1941, but
the past two years have brought
about three or four times as many
changes as the Ellington band has
ever had. Results are that the
music is less distinctive, less per
sonal, and somewhat streamlined.
This is all too true when Ray
Nance, an ordinary trumpet play
er, a poor violinist, and an un
necessarily ever-pergforming show
man, is out in front as soloist. It
is not required that a violinst
assume an agonized, orgiastic ex
pression in order to produce
simple passage. Nance was such a
bad performer that when he came
out for his last violin solo the crowd
laughed before he even began
to play, Nance would have never
been tolerated in the old Ellington
band, and there would have been
no room for such ordinary musi
cians as Skippy Williams and
Jimmy Hamilton.
NANTON HIGHLIGHT
The highlight, of the evening wan
Joe Nanton’s coda on ‘Black and
Tan Fantasty.*^ Nanton’s plunger
trombone, although exploited some
times for comic effect is a favorite
in the Ellington band, especially
so since Johnny Hodges has taken
to playing only sentimentally, with
every appearance as a soloist wind
ing up in an ever-softening fadeout,
‘Rockin’ in Rhytm,” xvas a good
solid performance, and even Nance’s
fidle could not mar the beauty of
“Moon Mist.”
“Bakiff is a fascinating study
which perhaps belongs rightfully
in the same general category as
Starvinsky’s Shostakovich’s, and
even Ravel's ‘modern” composi
tions— superimposed on a steady
dance rhythm. The excerpts from
the ‘Brown” section of the much
discussed ‘Black, Brown, and Beige”
were most interesting.</text>

	<text>Jazz Is Called
Strong Weapon
Against Hates
Color Forgotten
When Earthy Beat
Grips Hearers
By WILLARD MOORE
I For the Associated Negro Press*
An eminent peer of the arts
stated recently, “Jazz is a weapon
against fascism: it is an instru
ment for building interracial soli
darity; it is a tool that welds peo
ples together.
Let us examine this statement,
carefully probing and weighing;
j the evidence. We go into a ball
room or theatre where entertain
ment is lavishly waxed with the
music of good hot jazz. As we en
ter, the loud steady gutbucket
tempo reaches out and warmly
greets us.
RACES MINGLE
There are supple dancers, nim
ble jitterbugs hustiing, scurrying
about. A shrieking congregation of
people who, being merry, whirl in
thump-mad happiness.If you will
look close you will see harmonious
fluids of races intermingling—
black, white, red. brown, all color
1 ed, all creeds, some standing to
listen, others densely packed
shoulder to shoulder, breathing
with intense hunger the air of true
music.
There is much freCom here, lm
1 niense freedom for jazz. Plain,
simple folks dancing and listen
ing to a simple art. A folks’ art,
a people’s music. What prejudice
there may be in the person ebbs
swiftly. All diabolical thoughts are
miserably crushed. No thoughts of
hate reign. No battering of super
iority or inferiority against one
another. There is just Jazz. Pure
hot music pouring out, which
swells and boosts all hearts into
unification of goodness. There i«
love here.
COLOR FORGOTTEN
i Whether the musician be black,
white or any other color or nat
ionality, when he takes a solo,
showing his intrical e technique of
mastering his chosen instrument,
there is instantly spontaneous ap
plause showing appreciation. Not
because of the color of skin, but
because the virtuoso has produced
through his classic skill a primi
tive art which soars to its utmost
perfection.
Let me svate nere anu now that
if all people were to appreciate
persons solely because of merit in
any and all elements of life, that
itself would boost mankind. White
and black musicians gig together,
enjoying one another’s musical
performances, etc., which all in all
has resulted in mixed bands. Thus
we have greater music based on
ability. Here without doubt our
democracy is unfurled.
The musicians' recognition of one
another’s craft, their amiable es
teem of each other’s phrasing,
technique and individuality pro
vides the necessary shading and
contrast which enlarges each musi
cian’s scope and talent. This bor
rowing and giving brings them
closer together, further creating
the bulwarks of a true democracy,
and wings artist and audience in
to spheres of a united front.
Yes, jazz is mass music. A peo
ple’s voice revolting. A forceful
tool, fashioned, shaped and mold
ed from the torn hearts of slaves
into a striking weapon against
fascism oppression in America. Af
ter years of bondage, the dormant
hate of the bondsmen began pul
sating. Weird songs burst from
broken lips. Jazz! A musical pro
test sprang from split wombs of
misery. A mighty weapon had
come into being, a weapon that
will do its part in killing fascism.</text>
